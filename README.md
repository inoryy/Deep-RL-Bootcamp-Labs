### Solutions to the [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp) labs

* [Prelab](prelab): Set up your computer for all labs.
* [Lab 1](lab1): Markov Decision Processes. You will implement value iteration, policy iteration, and tabular Q-learning and apply these algorithms to simple environments including tabular maze navigation (FrozenLake) and controlling a simple crawler robot.
* [Lab 2](lab2): Introduction to Chainer. You will implement deep supervised learning using Chainer, and apply it to the MNIST dataset.
* [Lab 3](lab3): Deep Q-Learning. You will implement the DQN algorithm and apply it to Atari games.
* Lab 4: Policy Optimization Algorithms. You will implement various policy optimization algorithms, including policy gradient, natural policy gradient, trust-region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). You will apply these algorithms to classic control tasks, Atari games, and roboschool locomotion environments.
